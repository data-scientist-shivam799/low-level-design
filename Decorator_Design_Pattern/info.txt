The decorator pattern is a structural pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting 
the behavior of other objects from the same class.

The decorator pattern is useful when you want to add responsibilities to objects without subclassing. It involves a set of decorator classes that are used 
to wrap concrete components.
